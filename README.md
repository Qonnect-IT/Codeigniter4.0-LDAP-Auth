# Codeigniter4.0-LDAP-Auth
Codeigniter 4 compatible LDAP Authentication Module

This module can be used to add LDAP Authentication to Codeigniter 4. Inspiration was found in the [Auth_Ldap](https://github.com/gwojtak/Auth_Ldap) project. However the Auth_Ldap project did not account for configurable options needed to authenticate against Microsoft Windows Active Directory.

Installation done manually, by placing the files in the same-named directories in your CI Project.

Make sure php-ldap is installed (there is a check in place).
